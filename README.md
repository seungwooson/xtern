# xtern

This is coding challenge for Xtern 2018 Summer Internship program for Data Science. I used GeoPandas to map coordinates onto a visible platform, then used KMeans clustering methods to assign labels to the cluster regions that each data points are in. Then I used Facebook's forecasting tool Prophet to conduct univariate regression analysis and visualization to get a better sense of which day of the week at which region a user is likely to be in.
